# Jam
### The Jam Programming Language

With Jam you can currently only compile stuff like `15*(5+2)` and `print("Hi\n");` into C++

## Compiling
You can compile the compiler with `make build` and then you can compile .jam files with `jam input.ja output`
# make sure to make the directory build
(also dont mkdir build/jam)
