# Jam

## Compiling
To compile a .ja file, you first need to have the source code (everything in /src/) on your system. Once you have that make sure that g++ is in your environment variables. Compile the source code using this terminal command in your /src/ directory

```bash
g++ -o jam jam.cpp
```
